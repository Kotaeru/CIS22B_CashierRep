So to edit files you need to create a branch with the drop down menu that says branch. That'll basically create a copy for you to edit of the master file. Then you go to the branch you created click on the file and then the little pencil so you can edit the file. After you finish editing you have to make a pull request to send your changes to everyone. If we all like what you did then it'll add your changes to the master file. That's about it. If you want to try it try adding your name to the README.md file and submitting the pull request. Or change the cpp file.
Do not make changes to the master files otherwise we can't all read your changes. Always make changes to a new branch and submit the pull request so we can all see your changes before I update the code.
